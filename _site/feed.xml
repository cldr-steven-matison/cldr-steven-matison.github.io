<h1 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h1>

<h2 id="event-driven-applications">Event-Driven Applications</h2>

<p>Stateful applications that ingest events from one-or more-event streams and react to incoming events by triggering computations, state updates, or external actions.</p>

<p>Apache Flink excels in handling the concept of time and state for these applications, and can scale to manage very large data volumes (up to several terabytes). It has a rich set of APIs, ranging from low-level controls to high-level functionality, like Flink SQL, enabling developers to choose the most suitable options for the implementation of advanced business logic.</p>

<p>Apache Flink’s outstanding feature for event-driven applications is its support for savepoints. A savepoint is a consistent state image that can be used as a starting point for compatible applications. Given a savepoint, an application can be updated or adapt its scale, or multiple versions of an application can be started for A/B testing.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fraud detection</li>
  <li>Anomaly detection</li>
  <li>Rule-based alerting</li>
  <li>Business process monitoring</li>
  <li>Web application (social network)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-analytics-applications">Data Analytics Applications</h2>

<p>With a sophisticated stream processing engine, analytics can be performed in real-time. Streaming queries or applications ingest real-time event streams and continuously produce and update results as events are consumed. The results are written to an external database or maintained as internal state. A dashboard application can read the latest results from the external database or directly query the internal state of the application.</p>

<p>Apache Flink supports streaming as well as batch analytical applications.</p>

<h3 id="examples-1">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Quality monitoring of telco networks</li>
  <li>Analysis of product updates &amp; experiment evaluation in mobile applications</li>
  <li>Ad-hoc analysis of live data in consumer technology</li>
  <li>Large-scale graph analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-pipeline-applications">Data Pipeline Applications</h2>

<p>Streaming data pipelines serve a similar purpose as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) jobs. They transform and enrich data and can move it from one storage system to another. However, they operate in a continuous streaming mode instead of being periodically triggered. Hence, they can read records from sources that continuously produce data and move it with low latency to their destination.</p>

<h3 id="examples-2">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Real-time search index building in e-commerce</li>
  <li>Continuous ETL in e-commerce</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="kraft-kafka-raft-is-generally-available">KRaft (Kafka Raft) is generally available</h2>
<p>You can now deploy Kafka clusters that use KRaft instead of ZooKeeper for metadata management. Additionally, you can migrate existing ZooKeeper-based Kafka clusters to use KRaft. 
With the addition of KRaft, ZooKeeper is deprecated. Deploying new or using existing Kafka clusters running in ZooKeeper mode is deprecated. Additionally, ZooKeeper will be removed in a future release. When deploying new Kafka clusters, deploy them in KRaft mode. Cloudera encourages you to migrate existing clusters to KRaft. 
For cluster deployment instructions, see <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csm-operator/1.3/kafka-deploy-configure/topics/csm-op-deploying-kafka.html#concept_oks_bgz_z1c">Deploying a Kafka cluster</a>.

<h2 id="auto-rebalancing-when-scaling-the-cluster">Auto-rebalancing when scaling the cluster</h2>
<p>You can now enable auto-rebalancing for Kafka clusters. If auto-rebalancing is enabled, the Strimzi Cluster Operator automatically initiates a rebalance with Cruise Control when you scale the Kafka cluster. 
Cloudera recommends that you enable this feature as it makes scaling easier and faster. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csm-operator/1.3/kafka-operations/topics/csm-op-scaling-brokers.html#concept_jt1_qhz_z1c">Scaling brokers</a>.</p>

<h2 id="offset-management-through-kafkaconnector-resources-is-now-available">Offset management through KafkaConnector resources is now available</h2>
<p>Connector offsets can now be managed directly by configuring your KafkaConnector resources. 
Cloudera recommends that you use this feature over the Kafka Connect REST API to manage connector offsets.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csm-operator/1.3/kafka-connect-operations/topics/csm-op-connect-managing-connectors.html#ariaid-title8">Managing connector offsets</a> and <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csm-operator/1.3/kafka-replication-deploy-configure/topics/csm-op-connect-configuring-replication-offsets.html#task_jfl_lsg_jcc">Configuring data replication offsets</a>.

In this article I am going to share some tips and tricks I have learned after completing this install in Openshift, Rancher, and recently EKS.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/cfm-op-deployment-architecture.jpg" />
  <figcaption>CFM Deployment Architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First, lets start with the most recent version of the documenation for the Cloudera Apache NiFi Operator:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm-operator/2.9.1/index.html">CFM Operator 2.9.1</a></p>

<p>💡 There are already two new versions since my first article! 💡</p>

<h1 id="user-authentication">User Authentication</h1>

<p>There are several ways that you can role nifi user authentication.  First, no auth at all.  Just access the ui and NiFi is there.  Second, a self generated username and password upon install. Third, provide a kubernetes secret with your desired username and password.  Last but not least, <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm-operator/2.9.1/configure-nifi-cr/topics/cfm-op-config-nifi-ic-ldap.html">LDAP</a> which I will cover in a future post specifically.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/cfm-operator/2.9.1/configure-nifi-cr/topics/cfm-op-configure-nifi-auth.html">Configuring Authentication Docs</a></p>

<p>In order to secure the login for the NiFi UI, it is required that NiFi installation itself be secured.  Be sure to complete this step w/ your security cert issuer and then provide the correct tag in the nifi yaml.   In this example I am using a self signed cert, which you can find in my YAML repo at the end of this page.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">kubectl</span> <span class="n">apply</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">signed</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">ca</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">issuer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">yaml</span>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="ss">security:

        <span class="ss">kind: </span><span class="no">ClusterIssuer</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With the cert applied and referenced in the nifi.yaml, lets take a look at the requirements for enabling authentication methods.</p>

<h2 id="auto-generated-password">Auto Generated Password</h2>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="ss">spec:
  security:
    singleUserAuth:
      enabled: </span><span class="kp">true</span>

<h2 id="provided-credential">Provided Credential</h2>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="ss">spec:
  security:
    singleUserAuth:
      enabled: </span><span class="kp">true</span>
      <span class="ss">credentialsSecretName: </span><span class="n">nifi</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">credential</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">kubectl</span> <span class="n">create</span> <span class="n">secret</span> <span class="n">generic</span> <span class="n">nifi</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">credential</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">from</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">literal</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"username"</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">from</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">literal</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">password</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"123456789101112"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>💡 It is important to know, if your kubernetes secret is less than 12 characters, it will be ignored and nifi will still role with an auto generated username and password.💡</p>

<h1 id="ingress-and-uiconnection">Ingress and uiConnection</h1>

<p>The most important part of the Apache NiFi Operator installation are the steps required to expose the NiFI UI.</p>

<h2 id="route">Route</h2>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="ss">uiConnection:

<h1 id="when-to-delete-and-apply">When to Delete and Apply</h1>

<p>It is important to know when to delete your nifi deployment and apply again for a fresh install so be careful when applying changes and expecting the changed yaml to fully re-install nifi.</p>

<p>When doing things like above with authentication and security the initial nifi installation takes different and appropriate paths.   Sometimes you may have to delete nifi, wait for termination to complete, and then apply again in order to take a full fresh install.</p>

<h1 id="customizations-for-nifi-sizing">Customizations For NiFi Sizing</h1>

<p>When testing deployment processes in a small or limited kubernetes environment, it may be required to provide some limits on the resources nifi needs.</p>

This customer already has deep experience with nifi, python, and even custom java processors.   As a user of Cloudera Dataflow it has been a very long time since I have had to build and make my own nifi processors.  I also have not had to manage any nifi file systems behind these custom processors.   This is because Cloudera DataFlow allows me to nifi without all the hard parts of the old nifi experience.   Historically making a custom nifi processor was super complicated java and required developer tools, IDEs and deep programming knowledge around the inner workings of nifi source code.  Not anymore with NiFi 2.0…</p>

<p>In this blog I am going to show how easy it is to feed python source code on s3 into a nifi data flow without all those sharpe edges.</p>

<p>First,  I need to research the upstream <a href="https://nifi.apache.org/nifi-docs/python-developer-guide.html">documentation</a> for examples.  This one is a great starting point CreateFlowfile:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next I need to build out the basic samples that validate the documented process works to deploy a custom python processor.  I delivered the above code to s3 and use that in my deployment:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/nifi-python-processor-storage-location-1.png" />
  <figcaption>Cloudera DataFlow Custom Python Processsor Storage Location</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I am further automating this configuration so the deployment looks like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/nifi-python-processor-storage-location-2.png" />
  <figcaption>Cloudera DataFlow Custom Python Processsor Storage Location</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now when I deploy this flow, this processor is available:</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/nifi-python-processor-createflowfile.png" />
  <figcaption>Cloudera DataFlow Custom Python Processsor Storage Location</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next, I can focus on modifying the working example for my Fraud Detection use case.   That sample script is well tested and its python source code has been used within an ExecuteScript Processor.  I just need to make some very basic changes to merge my example python processor with the same python from my ExecuteScript processor.</p>

<p>My final python processor</p>

<p>And the source code is closely as follows:</p>

As a user of Cloudera Dataflow it has been a very long time since I have had to build and make my own nifi processors. I also have not had to manage any nifi file systems behind these custom processors. This is because Cloudera DataFlow allows me to nifi without all the hard parts of the old nifi experience.

This release includes improvements to SQL Stream Builder as well as updates to Apache Flink 1.19.1. These changes are focused on enhancing the user experience and removing objections and blockers in the sales cycle.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csa/latest/release-notes/topics/csa-what-new.html">What’s New</a>.</p>

<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Rebase to Apache Flink 1.19.1: Streaming analytics deployments, including SQL Stream Builder, now support Apache Flink 1.19.1, which includes the Apache Flink improvements below. For more information on these improvements and deprecations, please check the Apache Flink 1.19.1 release announcement.
    <ul>
      <li>Custom Parallelism for Table/SQL Sources: The DataGen connector now supports setting of custom parallelism for performance tuning via the scan.parallelism option. Support for other connectors will come in future releases.</li>
      <li>Configure Different State Time to Live (TTLs) Using SQL Hint: Users have now a more flexible way to specify custom time-to-live (TTL) values for state of regular joins and group aggregations directly within their queries by utilizing the STATE_TTL hint.</li>
      <li>Named Parameters: Named parameters can now be used when calling a function or stored procedure in Flink SQL.</li>
      <li>Support for SESSION Window Table-Valued Functions (TVFs) in Streaming Mode: Users can now use SESSION Window table-valued functions (TVF) in streaming mode.</li>
      <li>Support for Changelog Inputs for Window TVF Aggregation: Window aggregation operators can now handle changelog streams (e.g., Change Data Capture [CDC] data sources, etc.).</li>
      <li>New UDF Type: AsyncScalarFunction: The new AsyncScalarFunction is a user-defined asynchronous ScalarFunction that allows for issuing concurrent function calls asynchronously.</li>
      <li>MiniBatch Optimization for Regular Joins: The new mini-batch optimization can be used in regular joins to reduce intermediate results, especially in cascading join scenarios.</li>
      <li>Dynamic Source Parallelism Inference for Batch Jobs: Allows source connectors to dynamically infer the parallelism based on the actual amount of data to consume.</li>
      <li>Standard Yet Another Markup Language (YAML) for Apache Flink Configuration: Apache Flink has officially introduced full support for the standard YAML 1.2 syntax in the configuration file.</li>
      <li>Profiling JobManager/TaskManager on Apache Flink Web: Support for triggering profiling at the JobManager/TaskManager level.</li>
      <li>New Config Options for Administrator Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Options: A set of administrator JVM options are available to prepend the user-set JVM options with default values for platform-wide JVM tuning.</li>
      <li>Using Larger Checkpointing Interval When Source is Processing Backlog: Users can set the execution.checkpointing.interval-during-backlog to use a larger checkpoint interval to enhance the throughput while the job is processing backlog if the source is backlog-aware.</li>
      <li>CheckpointsCleaner Clean Individual Checkpoint States in Parallel: Now, when disposing of no longer needed checkpoints, every state handle/state file will be disposed in parallel for better performance.</li>
      <li>Trigger Checkpoints through Command Line Client: The command line interface supports triggering a checkpoint manually.</li>
      <li>New Interfaces to SinkV2 That Are Consistent with Source API.</li>
      <li>New Committer Metrics to Track the Status of Committables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Support for Python User-Defined Functions (UDFs) in SQL Stream Builder: The current Javascript UDFs in SQL Stream Builder will not work in Java 17 and later versions due to the deprecation and removal of the Nashorn engine from the Java Development Kit (JDK). The addition of Python UDFs to SQL Stream Builder will allow customers to use Python to create new UDFs that will continue to be supported on future JDKs. Javascript UDFs are being deprecated in this release and will be removed in a future release. Cloudera recommends that customers start using Python UDFs for all new development and start migrating their JavaScript UDFs to Python UDFs to prepare for future upgrades.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Currently, Cloudera Streaming Analytics 1.14 only supports JDK versions 8 and 11.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>SQL Stream Builder support for load balancing via Knox for HA deployments: Knox now automatically discovers and provides a load balanced endpoint for SQL Stream Builder when multiple instances of the streaming engine are deployed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Global logging configuration for Configuring logs for all SSB jobs: A new global settings view enables default logging configurations to be set by the administrator. These settings will be applied to all streaming jobs by default and can be overridden at the job level. This ensures that a consistent logging standard can be applied by default for all users and developers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please see the <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csa/1.14.0/release-notes/topics/csa-what-new.html">Release Notes</a> for the complete list of fixes and improvements.</p>

<h1 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Event-Driven Applications: Stateful applications that ingest events from one or more event streams and react to incoming events by triggering computations, state updates, or external actions.</p>

    <p>Apache Flink excels in handling the concept of time and state for these applications and can scale to manage very large data volumes (up to several terabytes) with exactly once consistency guarantees. Moreover, Apache Flink’s support for event-time, highly customizable window logic, and fine-grained control of time as provided by the ProcessFunction enable the implementation of advanced business logic. Moreover, Apache Flink features a library for Complex Event Processing (CEP) to detect patterns in data streams.</p>

    <p>However, Apache Flink’s outstanding feature for event-driven applications is its support for savepoints. A savepoint is a consistent state image that can be used as a starting point for compatible applications. Given a savepoint, an application can be updated or adapt its scale, or multiple versions of an application can be started for A/B testing.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fraud detection</li>
      <li>Anomaly detection</li>
      <li>Rule-based alerting</li>
      <li>Business process monitoring</li>
      <li>Web application (social network)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data Analytics Applications: With a sophisticated stream processing engine, analytics can also be performed in real-time. Streaming queries or applications ingest real-time event streams and continuously produce and update results as events are consumed. The results are written to an external database or maintained as internal state. A dashboard application can read the latest results from the external database or directly query the internal state of the application.</p>

    <p>Apache Flink supports streaming as well as batch analytical applications.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality monitoring of telco networks</li>
      <li>Analysis of product updates &amp; experiment evaluation in mobile applications</li>
      <li>Ad-hoc analysis of live data in consumer technology</li>
      <li>Large-scale graph analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data Pipeline Applications: Streaming data pipelines serve a similar purpose as Extract-transform-load (ETL) jobs. They transform and enrich data and can move it from one storage system to another. However, they operate in a continuous streaming mode instead of being periodically triggered. Hence, they can read records from sources that continuously produce data and move it with low latency to their destination.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time search index building in e-commerce</li>
      <li>Continuous ETL in e-commerce</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

This is a single software release available for both cloud and on-premises environments that enable capabilities, workloads, and governance to work and feel the same everywhere.</p>

<p>With the cohesion of Cloudera on cloud 7.2.18 and Cloudera on premises 7.1.9 into a streamlined 7.3.1 version, customers can now benefit from our accelerated pace of innovation with simpler versioning. This unified release provides a consistent feature set across all deployment environments – whether on-premises or in the cloud.</p>

<p>This milestone release unleashes the power of true hybrid capabilities for data management, enabling data and analytics running on-premises and across multiple clouds to be managed cohesively and federated into a unified whole. Cloudera is the only platform transforming customers’ data management and data journeys by enabling the seamless movement of data and workloads across all environments.</p>

<p><b><i>Welcome to the future of hybrid data solutions with Cloudera!</i></b></p>

<h1 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hive and Iceberg integration: The integration of Apache Hive with Apache Iceberg brings modern, open-table format capabilities to Hive’s powerful data warehousing features. With increased performance and scalability, Hive users can easily work with large, complex datasets across both cloud and on-premises environments. Iceberg’s support for schema evolution, time travel, and ACID compliance allows Hive users to manage data changes seamlessly and query historical data snapshots without compromising on performance. This powerful combination streamlines data management, enhances flexibility, and opens new doors for efficient data operations in hybrid environments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graviton support (tech preview): This release supports AWS Graviton processors, allowing our platform to harness the powerful, cost-efficient capabilities of Arm-based EC2 instances. Customers can now achieve up to 40% better price performance for data-intensive workloads, making large-scale data processing both faster and more accessible. Graviton support not only enhances processing speeds and reduces operational costs, but it also aligns with our commitment to flexible, cloud-optimized performance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>SQL Assistant:  Hue now leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform data interaction with its SQL AI assistant. Generate SQL queries from natural language, optimize, explain, and fix them effortlessly. Compatible with OpenAI’s GPT, Amazon Bedrock, and Azure’s OpenAI, Hue offers the flexibility to choose the AI service that suits you best.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for Amazon S3 Express One Zone Storage: Cloud connectors now offer high-performance, single-availability Zone storage with consistent single-digit millisecond access. By storing data in the same Availability Zone as your compute resources, you can optimize performance, reduce costs, and accelerate workloads. This storage class supports hundreds of thousands of requests per second for seamless scalability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved security posture: This release addresses 225+ total Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) which reflects our strong commitment to safeguarding data and ensuring a secure, resilient environment for our users. Each CVE resolution bolsters the integrity and stability of our platform, protecting against potential threats across all deployment environments – whether on-premises or in the cloud, or hybrid.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="additional-features">Additional Features:</h1>
