This acquisition marks a pivotal moment in Cloudera’s evolution from a big data pioneer to a comprehensive Hybrid Data and AI leader.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="a-brief-history-from-hadoop-to-hybrid-ai">A Brief History: From Hadoop to Hybrid AI</h2>

<p>Cloudera’s journey began in 2008 as a visionary in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, eventually merging with its primary rival, Hortonworks, in 2019. Since then, the company has pivoted aggressively toward the <strong>Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)</strong>, a hybrid solution that manages data across on-premises and multi-cloud environments.</p>

<p>Octopai, founded in 2016, carved out a niche as the gold standard for automated data discovery and lineage. By the time of the merger, Octopai was already famous for its ability to map complex data environments in seconds—something that traditionally took manual weeks or months. By bringing Octopai into the fold, Cloudera has essentially added the “GPS” to its massive data warehouse and lakehouse offerings, allowing users to see exactly where their data comes from and where it is going.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="cloudera-data-lineage-powering-the-era-of-convergence">Cloudera Data Lineage: Powering the “Era of Convergence”</h2>

<p>Now fully integrated as <strong>Cloudera Data Lineage</strong>, the platform has received a massive overhaul to support the modern data estate. Cloudera has introduced over <strong>60 native connectors</strong> designed to bridge the gap between traditional big data systems and real-time streaming architectures.</p>

<h3 id="deep-integration-with-nifi-and-kafka">Deep Integration with NiFi and Kafka</h3>
<p>A standout update is the deep integration with <strong>Apache NiFi (Cloudera DataFlow)</strong> and <strong>Apache Kafka</strong>. The new NiFi connectors allow for <strong>“cross-system lineage,”</strong> meaning as data is ingested from the edge and transformed through various processors, the lineage is captured automatically. This prevents the “black box” effect often seen in data-in-motion.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <strong>Kafka connectors</strong> enable organizations to track ephemeral streaming data, ensuring that real-time insights are just as governed and auditable as static data in HDFS or S3.</p>

<h3 id="ai-driven-governance">AI-Driven Governance</h3>
<p>Beyond just connectivity, Cloudera has added the <strong>Octomize AI agent</strong>, which uses generative AI to help data teams optimize SQL queries and automatically document data flows. These features transform Cloudera Data Lineage from a simple map into an active intelligence layer, essential for meeting the strict requirements of GDPR, HIPAA, and the governance needs of enterprise-scale AI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The fusion of Octopai’s metadata discovery engine with Cloudera’s big data backbone provides Cloudera Data Lineage; a unified view of data health, from the first spark of ingestion to the final AI model.</p>

<h1 id="clouderas-evolution-from-big-data-to-enterprise-ai-20212026">Cloudera’s Evolution: From Big Data to Enterprise AI (2021–2026)</h1>

<p>In the last 3 to 5 years, Cloudera has undergone a major strategic transformation, shifting from a focus on <strong>Big Data and Machine Learning (ML)</strong> to becoming a comprehensive <strong>Enterprise AI platform</strong>.</p>

<p>This transition was driven by the market’s move from predictive models to <strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> and the need for businesses to run AI on their own data without compromising security.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-strategic-pivot-20212023">The Strategic Pivot (2021–2023)</h3>
<p>Cloudera began moving away from its legacy as a Hadoop-based “Big Data” company toward the <strong>Cloudera Data Platform (CDP)</strong>, a hybrid data cloud. During this phase:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>From ML to AI:</strong> The company rebranded “Cloudera Machine Learning” to <strong>Cloudera AI</strong>. This signaled a shift toward embedding intelligence into business processes rather than just building isolated models.</li>
  <li><strong>The Data Lakehouse:</strong> They popularized the “Open Data Lakehouse” (built on <strong>Apache Iceberg</strong>), which provided the structured, governed foundation necessary for large-scale AI.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-generative-ai--agentic-era-20242025">The Generative AI &amp; Agentic Era (2024–2025)</h3>
<p>With the explosion of GenAI, Cloudera shifted its product roadmap to support Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous agents.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strategic Acquisitions:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verta (May 2024):</strong> Acquired for its AI operational platform to strengthen model management and “ModelOps.”</li>
      <li><strong>Octopai (Nov 2024):</strong> Added automated data lineage to ensure AI models use trustworthy, traceable data.</li>
      <li><strong>Taikun (Aug 2025):</strong> Integrated Kubernetes management to allow AI workloads to run seamlessly across any cloud or on-prem environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>AI-Specific Tools:</strong> They launched <strong>Cloudera AI Studios</strong> and <strong>AMPs</strong> (Accelerators for Machine Learning Projects), providing templates for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and AI agents.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Event-Driven Applications:</strong> Stateful applications that ingest events from one or more event streams and react to incoming events by triggering computations, state updates, or external actions. Apache Flink excels in handling the concept of time and state for these applications, and can scale to manage very large data volumes (up to several terabytes). It has a rich set of APIs, ranging from low-level controls to high-level functionality, like Flink SQL, enabling developers to choose the most suitable options for the implementation of advanced business logic. One of Apache Flink’s most popular features for event-driven applications is its support for savepoints. A savepoint is a consistent state image that can be used as a starting point for compatible applications. With a savepoint, an application can be updated or adapt its scale, or multiple versions of an application can be started for A/B testing.
  <strong>Examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Fraud detection</li>
      <li>Anomaly detection</li>
      <li>Rule-based alerting</li>
      <li>Business process monitoring</li>
      <li>Web application (social network)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Analytics Applications:</strong> With a sophisticated stream processing engine, analytics can be performed in real time. Streaming queries or applications ingest real-time event streams and continuously produce and update results as events are consumed. The results are written to an external database or maintained as internal state. A dashboard application can read the latest results from the external database or directly query the internal state of the application. Apache Flink supports streaming as well as batch analytical applications.
  <strong>Examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality monitoring of telco networks</li>
      <li>Analysis of product updates and experiment evaluation in mobile applications</li>
      <li>Ad-hoc analysis of live data in consumer technology</li>
      <li>Large-scale graph analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Pipeline Applications:</strong> Streaming data pipelines serve a similar purpose as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) jobs. They transform and enrich data and can move it from one storage system to another. However, they operate in a continuous streaming mode instead of being periodically triggered. Hence, they can read records from sources that continuously produce data and move it with low latency to their destination.
  <strong>Examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time search index building in e-commerce</li>
      <li>Continuous ETL in e-commerce</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This release offers a number of new features and improvements as well as upgraded dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="key-features-for-this-release">Key features for this release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>NiFi 2.3:</strong> Cloudera Flow Management 2.2.9 for DataHub contains an image based on Apache NiFi 2.3.0 and adds several new features not available in previous versions of Apache NiFi.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New Features and Components in Apache NiFi 2.3:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Support for copying and pasting flow definitions between separate NiFi deployments</li>
          <li>Several new processors integrating with Box, allowing users to leverage Box as a cloud storage solution</li>
          <li>GetS3ObjectTags - Retrieves object tags for a file in S3</li>
          <li>PEMEncodedSSLContextProvider - an SSLContext Provider configurable using PEM Private Key and Certificate files, providing a more secure solution for TLS-based connections</li>
          <li>StandardDatabaseDialectService - A controller service to generate SQL statements for the specified database dialect (MySQL, Oracle, e.g.), providing a simpler approach for configuring database-related processors to support various SQL dialects</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>New Components in Cloudera Flow Management 2.2.9 for DataHub (based on Apache NiFi 2.3.0):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>SawmillTransformRecord and SawmillTransformJSON - Uses the Sawmill transformation DSL to transform incoming FlowFiles, providing an additional and powerful method to transform FlowFile content</li>
          <li>New controller services providing better integration with Cloudera Flow Management Registry</li>
          <li>PhoenixThickConnectionPool and PhoenixThinConnectionPool - Database Connection Pool controller services integrating with Phoenix (SQL on HBase) either using the thin or thick driver (both included), enabling more connections from NiFi, such as to Cloudera Operational Database</li>
          <li>RESTCatalogService (in Technical Preview) - Catalog controller service for integrating with external REST-based Iceberg catalogs such as Apache Polaris</li>
