</ul>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Event-Driven Applications:</strong> Stateful applications that ingest events from one or more event streams and react to incoming events by triggering computations, state updates, or external actions. Apache Flink excels in handling the concept of time and state for these applications, and can scale to manage very large data volumes (up to several terabytes). It has a rich set of APIs, ranging from low-level controls to high-level functionality, like Flink SQL, enabling developers to choose the most suitable options for the implementation of advanced business logic. One of Apache Flink’s most popular features for event-driven applications is its support for savepoints. A savepoint is a consistent state image that can be used as a starting point for compatible applications. With a savepoint, an application can be updated or adapt its scale, or multiple versions of an application can be started for A/B testing.
  <strong>Examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Fraud detection</li>
      <li>Anomaly detection</li>
      <li>Rule-based alerting</li>
      <li>Business process monitoring</li>
      <li>Web application (social network)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Analytics Applications:</strong> With a sophisticated stream processing engine, analytics can be performed in real time. Streaming queries or applications ingest real-time event streams and continuously produce and update results as events are consumed. The results are written to an external database or maintained as internal state. A dashboard application can read the latest results from the external database or directly query the internal state of the application. Apache Flink supports streaming as well as batch analytical applications.
  <strong>Examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality monitoring of telco networks</li>
      <li>Analysis of product updates and experiment evaluation in mobile applications</li>
      <li>Ad-hoc analysis of live data in consumer technology</li>
      <li>Large-scale graph analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Pipeline Applications:</strong> Streaming data pipelines serve a similar purpose as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) jobs. They transform and enrich data and can move it from one storage system to another. However, they operate in a continuous streaming mode instead of being periodically triggered. Hence, they can read records from sources that continuously produce data and move it with low latency to their destination.
  <strong>Examples:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time search index building in e-commerce</li>
      <li>Continuous ETL in e-commerce</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This release offers a number of new features and improvements as well as upgraded dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="key-features-for-this-release">Key features for this release</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>NiFi 2.3:</strong> Cloudera Flow Management 2.2.9 for DataHub contains an image based on Apache NiFi 2.3.0 and adds several new features not available in previous versions of Apache NiFi.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New Features and Components in Apache NiFi 2.3:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Support for copying and pasting flow definitions between separate NiFi deployments</li>
          <li>Several new processors integrating with Box, allowing users to leverage Box as a cloud storage solution</li>
          <li>GetS3ObjectTags - Retrieves object tags for a file in S3</li>
          <li>PEMEncodedSSLContextProvider - an SSLContext Provider configurable using PEM Private Key and Certificate files, providing a more secure solution for TLS-based connections</li>
          <li>StandardDatabaseDialectService - A controller service to generate SQL statements for the specified database dialect (MySQL, Oracle, e.g.), providing a simpler approach for configuring database-related processors to support various SQL dialects</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>New Components in Cloudera Flow Management 2.2.9 for DataHub (based on Apache NiFi 2.3.0):</strong>
        <ul>

<h2 id="getting-to-the-new-release">Getting to the New Release</h2>
<p>To upgrade to Cloudera Streaming Analytics 1.15.0 on Cloudera on premises, check out <a href="https://docs.cloudera.com/csa/1.15.0/installation/topics/csa-upgrade.html">this upgrade guide</a>. If you are using Cloudera on cloud, refer to the Upgrade advisor documentation.</p>

<h1 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Event-Driven Applications: Stateful applications that ingest events from one or more event streams and react to incoming events by triggering computations, state updates, or external actions.</p>

    <p>Apache Flink excels in handling the concept of time and state for these applications and can scale to manage very large data volumes (up to several terabytes) with exactly once consistency guarantees. Moreover, Apache Flink’s support for event-time, highly customizable window logic, and fine-grained control of time as provided by the ProcessFunction enable the implementation of advanced business logic. Moreover, Apache Flink features a library for Complex Event Processing (CEP) to detect patterns in data streams.</p>

    <p>However, Apache Flink’s outstanding feature for event-driven applications is its support for savepoints. A savepoint is a consistent state image that can be used as a starting point for compatible applications. Given a savepoint, an application can be updated or adapt its scale, or multiple versions of an application can be started for A/B testing.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fraud detection</li>
      <li>Anomaly detection</li>
      <li>Rule-based alerting</li>
      <li>Business process monitoring</li>
      <li>Web application (social network)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data Analytics Applications: With a sophisticated stream processing engine, analytics can also be performed in real-time. Streaming queries or applications ingest real-time event streams and continuously produce and update results as events are consumed. The results are written to an external database or maintained as internal state. A dashboard application can read the latest results from the external database or directly query the internal state of the application.</p>

    <p>Apache Flink supports streaming as well as batch analytical applications.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality monitoring of telco networks</li>
      <li>Analysis of product updates &amp; experiment evaluation in mobile applications</li>
      <li>Ad-hoc analysis of live data in consumer technology</li>
      <li>Large-scale graph analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data Pipeline Applications: Streaming data pipelines serve a similar purpose as Extract-transform-load (ETL) jobs. They transform and enrich data and can move it from one storage system to another. However, they operate in a continuous streaming mode instead of being periodically triggered. Hence, they can read records from sources that continuously produce data and move it with low latency to their destination.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time search index building in e-commerce</li>
      <li>Continuous ETL in e-commerce</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h1>

<h2 id="event-driven-applications">Event-Driven Applications</h2>

<p>Stateful applications that ingest events from one-or more-event streams and react to incoming events by triggering computations, state updates, or external actions.</p>

<p>Apache Flink excels in handling the concept of time and state for these applications, and can scale to manage very large data volumes (up to several terabytes). It has a rich set of APIs, ranging from low-level controls to high-level functionality, like Flink SQL, enabling developers to choose the most suitable options for the implementation of advanced business logic.</p>

<p>Apache Flink’s outstanding feature for event-driven applications is its support for savepoints. A savepoint is a consistent state image that can be used as a starting point for compatible applications. Given a savepoint, an application can be updated or adapt its scale, or multiple versions of an application can be started for A/B testing.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fraud detection</li>
  <li>Anomaly detection</li>
  <li>Rule-based alerting</li>
  <li>Business process monitoring</li>
  <li>Web application (social network)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-analytics-applications">Data Analytics Applications</h2>

<p>With a sophisticated stream processing engine, analytics can be performed in real-time. Streaming queries or applications ingest real-time event streams and continuously produce and update results as events are consumed. The results are written to an external database or maintained as internal state. A dashboard application can read the latest results from the external database or directly query the internal state of the application.</p>

<p>Apache Flink supports streaming as well as batch analytical applications.</p>

<h3 id="examples-1">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Quality monitoring of telco networks</li>
  <li>Analysis of product updates &amp; experiment evaluation in mobile applications</li>
  <li>Ad-hoc analysis of live data in consumer technology</li>
  <li>Large-scale graph analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="data-pipeline-applications">Data Pipeline Applications</h2>

<p>Streaming data pipelines serve a similar purpose as Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) jobs. They transform and enrich data and can move it from one storage system to another. However, they operate in a continuous streaming mode instead of being periodically triggered. Hence, they can read records from sources that continuously produce data and move it with low latency to their destination.</p>

<h3 id="examples-2">Examples:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Real-time search index building in e-commerce</li>
  <li>Continuous ETL in e-commerce</li>
</ul>
