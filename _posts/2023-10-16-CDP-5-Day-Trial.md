I finally got a chance to test out the CDP Data In Motion Trial within Cloudera's new 5 Day Public Cloud Trial.  I followed the link below and within 24 hours after signing up I got an email with a link to get started.  Three simple clicks later I am logged in to the familiar landing page for Cloudera Public Cloud:
