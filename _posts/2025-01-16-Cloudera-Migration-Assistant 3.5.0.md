Cloudera is excited to announce the General Availability of Cloudera Migration Assistant with the release of the 3.5.0 version. Cloudera’s go-to migration tool now supports migrating Spark2 and Spark3 workloads from Cloudera on premises to Cloudera on cloud, as well as automated execution of migrated workloads with Livy, for a seamless workload migration audit experience. 

Cloudera’s vision is to make Cloudera Migration Assistant the de facto standard tool for cloud migration to Cloudera on cloud, enabling a streamlined, assisted, automated experience. 

# Key Features and Capabilities: 

  - Redesigned Migration View: The main user interface of Cloudera Migration Assistant got a significant update for easier navigation throughout the migration process.
  - Automatic Discovery: Cloudera Migration Assistant detects HDFS files as well as HMS and HBase tables in source clusters for a seamless migration setup.
  - Workload Identification: Supports migration of SQL, Oozie, and Spark workloads, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
  - Dependency Mapping and Planning: Assists in identifying dependencies and planning migration strategies with precision.
  - Controlled Execution: Enables managed and observable execution of complex migrations for greater transparency.
  - Reduced Manual Effort: Streamlined automation reduces the need for manual intervention, increasing efficiency.

Version 3.5.0 introduces new functionalities, implements a more modern architecture, increases product security posture, and adopts a streamlined development process to deliver updates to market more quickly. For organizations looking to migrate from legacy Cloudera Distribution of Hadoop (CDH) or Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) deployments, version 3.4.1 remains the Cloudera Migration Assistant of choice.
