We’re excited to announce the **general availability (GA)** of the Cloudera AI Inference service for on-premises deployments. This milestone marks a significant expansion of our private AI vision, allowing enterprises to deploy, scale, and govern the latest generative AI (GenAI) models directly within their own data centers.

Powered by **NVIDIA NIM**, the Cloudera AI Inference service provides the control and performance that enterprises need to accelerate innovation without compromising data security.

## Empowering True Private AI
Cloudera AI Inference for on-premises is engineered for organizations that demand absolute control over their intellectual property and data sovereignty.

* **Complete Data Privacy:** Ensure that sensitive data, prompts, and model responses never leave your secure corporate network, meeting strict regulatory requirements.
* **Air-Gapped Readiness:** Full support for highly secure, air-gapped environments, providing the tools and documentation necessary to import and manage models without external connectivity.
* **Storage Flexibility:** Full support to any S3-compatible object storage.

## Predictable TCO for Production AI
As enterprises move from experimentation to steady-state production, the on-premises service offers a significantly lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to token-based cloud APIs*.

The AI Inference on-premises service lowers long-term TCO by providing ownership of GPU infrastructure, which pays off fast when inference happens 24/7.


## Feature Highlights for Production-Grade AI
* **Optimized Performance:** Prebuilt and optimized engines, including **TensorRT-LLM** and **vLLM**, ensure low-latency, high-throughput inferencing.
* **Seamless Integration:** Integrate with existing MLOps workflows and CI/CD pipelines using OpenAI-compatible APIs for large language models (LLMs) and Open Inference Protocol APIs for traditional models.
* **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Track performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization in real-time to ensure operational continuity.
