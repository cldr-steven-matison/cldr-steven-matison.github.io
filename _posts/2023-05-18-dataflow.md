I wrote my first @Cloudera Community article on how to Operationalize NiFi with CDP Public Cloud's DataFlow Data Service.   NiFi is something I have been excited about for a very long time.   A major focus of this blog and my social media content will be around all of the new cool things Cloudera is doing with NiFi.

You can read the full article over at the Cloudera Community:
