UPDATED This is my first post for my new GitHub Pages deployed website.   This was something I did in my previous role @Datastax and you can find that page [here](https://ds-steven-matison.github.io).  Please give me some time to get familar with the Minimal Mistakes theme and the changes in capability and functionality with this jekyll github.io page.

In this blog I am going share all of the things that I have found around me in the Cloudera Data Platform.
