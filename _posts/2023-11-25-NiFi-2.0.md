NiFi 2.0 is getting closer and closer to a reality as we approach the end of 2023.   Version 2.0.0-M1 was released November 25, 2023 and is the first milestone version of Apache NiFi 2.0.0. This version includes over 900 issues resolved, with new features, numerous improvements, and bug fixes.

Features I am hearing the most about already in the community are:

1. Initial version of native Python API for Processors
2. Stateless Execution mode for Process Groups
3. Kubernetes-based Leader Election and State Management extensions
4. Python-based Processors for interacting with ChatGPT and Vector Databases


To prepare for NiFi Adoption be sure to give a read of Pierre Villard's blog [Getting Ready for NiFi 2.0](https://medium.com/cloudera-inc/getting-ready-for-apache-nifi-2-0-5a5e6a67f450).
